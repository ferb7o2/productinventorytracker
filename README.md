A React JS website will be integrated with an AWS database to fulfill a business' inventory tracking requirements. This new approach replaces the use of an Excel spreadsheet and offers improved efficiency and security, as it prevents data loss and can be accessed remotely with customizable rules and input restrictions based on the business' specific needs.

## How it works
To secure our site, we utilize Amazon Cognito and store data using Dynamo DB, which is based on relational databases. We retrieve the data to display it on the screen and use jQuery to easily obtain inputs and send API requests to update the data.
Internal logic to display and "connect" data was all created by me
